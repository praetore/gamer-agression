Was looking forward to this as soon as it was announced years ago. But my oh my is this game bad. Now it's better then most but going by the adverts and hype behind this thing,it has to be considered to be a huge letdown. The premise is brilliant but execution is poor. The main character is dull and lately a main character in a game is vital to enjoying it. That's not all though. Most of the gaming mechanics let you down. They are passable but not great. The driving however,wow,that is really bad!! Driving in Ground Zeros is better!
