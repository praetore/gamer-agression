Mediocre title.

The scenery graphics are great, the character graphics are lacking. Gunplay is a little ridiculous with a .45 1911 taking 4 to 5 shots to bring a guy down. Motivation is sketchy. Clara's voice acting is phoned in.

No melee. You can shoot ANYONE you want on the street. Random passerby? Shotgun them down. But can you use your fancy baton? Nope! Only for take downs. This was a major oversight and an unnecessary one.

Some more nit picky stuff: you can parkour your ass off but when it comes to slight inclines and rocks, you're stopped as cold in your tracks as if there was an invisible wall.

I would not recommend this game to anyone. The gimmick of hacking is fun for about a half hour. Traffic accidents, while startling, are ridiculous as the cars are catapulted from stop as if they were on an aircraft carrier.

If this is the result of several months of extra development, I would hate to have seen how shabby it was when it was supposed to come out.

Maybe Watch Dogs 2 will be better but since Assassin's Creed 1 wasn't this shoddy, I don't have high hopes for the next level of this series.
